Ratking is a stealth extraction video game made in 14 weeks in Unity for Abertay University's DES310 Module, developed under Modern Wolf. The goal of the project was to make an extraction game, but rather than having it focused on the high intensity action packed style that this genre tends to have we wanted to see how it would work if combined with a stealth game approach. In the game you play as a rat sneaking through a mansion that belongs to a cat baron, trying to steal their goods in order to upgrade your base, all while avoiding the well-trained guards protecting the mansion. For this project I was responsible for the AI and stealth mechanics.
